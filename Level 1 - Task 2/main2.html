            <h3>A Hotel Menu Card Webpage</h3>
            <p>I used HTML and CSS to build an interactive hotel menu card webpage for my web development project. This project was intended to demonstrate my aptitude for creating aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly web interfaces.
                The website has a chic and flexible layout that adjusts well to various screen sizes, giving users a consistent experience across devices. I divided the menu items into categories, such as appetizers, main dishes, desserts, and beverages, using HTML elements and CSS styling.
                In order to increase the visual appeal and aid clients in making educated decisions, each menu item is provided with attractive photographs, thorough descriptions, and costs. To increase the website's interaction, I used CSS to build hover effects that discreetly highlight menu items when users hover their mouse over them.</p>

            <h3>Book - </h3>
            <p>During my web development experience, I created "Bookworm's Haven," an interesting online bookstore dedicated to book lovers. Using HTML and CSS, I created a user-friendly and visually appealing platform that caters to readers' literary desires.
                The homepage greets visitors with an aesthetically beautiful layout that is filled with tempting book covers and a smooth navigation bar. I assured responsiveness across devices by using HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring an ideal reading experience on both desktop and mobile screens.
                I created a dynamic search function utilizing HTML forms and CSS stylings for book lovers looking for specific genres. The project also includes a beautifully created "Featured Books" section, where each book's image and title redirect to individual book pages.</p>

            <h3>Portfolio Website - </h3>
            <p>I developed an engaging online platform to showcase my love for photography throughout this web development project. The website for my photography portfolio functions as a digital gallery, showcasing a hand-picked selection of my best pictures and visual narratives.
                The website's simple layout and simple navigation make for an engaging user experience. I painstakingly designed each page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the essence of each shot.
                I used responsive design to improve the aesthetic appeal, allowing for fluid browsing on various devices. Visitors may study photographs in-depth without slowing down the loading process thanks to the presence of image sliders and lightboxes.
                The interactive contact section, where people can get in touch for questions and collaborations, is one of the highlights. Social media integration makes sharing my photographic work simple.
